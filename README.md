# Maze Treasure Hunt Using DFS and BFS Approach
> Suppose there is a maze with one or several treasures, and the maze needs to be explored. A program with a simple GUI is required to implement BFS and DFS algorithms to find the routes to collect all the treasures. The program should be able to accept input from a txt file and visualize the maze's structure along with the solution routes.

## Folder Structure
- `src` contains the source code of the program.
- `test` contains input txt files for testing purposes.
- `bin` contains the executable code.
- `doc` contains the report in PDF format.

## Program Requirement
- .NET 6.0 (latest release/stable version)
- Visual Studio 2022 (optional to compile program)

## How to Run the Program
1. Open the `bin` folder.
2. Run the `Tubes 2.exe` file.

## How to Compile the Program
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Select "Open a project or solution".
3. Navigate to `src` > `Tubes 2.sln`.
4. Press `Ctrl + B` or click on the green arrow in the top window.
5. The program will be built and run automatically.
6. The output of the program can also be found in the bin folder (search for the .exe file).

## How to Use
1. Click on `Add File` and select the txt file you want to input into the program.
2. Click on `Visualize` to visualize the maze from the txt file.
3. Select the search method, either `BFS` or `DFS`. Additionally, you can check `TSP` to perform the search for a solution that returns to the starting point.
4. If the input file is correct, the search process will be visualized.
5. To speed up or slow down the search, adjust the slider below.
6. Once the solution is displayed, the search is complete.
7. You can perform searches with other files by following the same steps from the beginning.
